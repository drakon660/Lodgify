The main problem, is that application is in .NET 3.1 which EOL had in 2022.

The structure of Asp.net Core is a way different since .NET 5

There was not a solution skeleton from my perspective, a few POCO and 
interfaces are not solution skeleton.

Basically this app is implemented in the way I practice with focus 
of implementing business logic inside domain (Core prject), because
i didn't speak to any domain expert in that matter (Cinema) I could be 
wrong where to put all invariants, but technically it is ok.
